CANCELLATION_POLICY = """
AirYatra Cancellation & Refund Policy (Detailed) — Version v1.0

Effective from: 03.08.2026
Applies to: AirYatra website/app bookings where payment is collected by AirYatra and flight is operated by independent DGCA-approved Operators.

1) Scope & Important Notes

• AirYatra facilitates bookings and collects payment; flight services are performed by the Operator.
• Refund outcomes depend on (a) when you cancel, (b) whether the Operator cancels, (c) regulatory/weather constraints, and (d) any non-refundable components disclosed at booking.
• If you accept an alternate flight/reschedule offered after a disruption, you will not be eligible for a refund for the same disruption.

2) How to Cancel / Request Refund

You can request cancellation/refund by:
• Logging into your AirYatra account and using My Bookings → Cancel, or
• Contacting AirYatra Support at care@airyatra.co.in with your Booking ID.

You should cancel before the scheduled departure time. If you do not cancel and you do not travel (no-show), refunds are generally not available except in limited force majeure situations and where reliably documented.

3) Customer-Initiated Cancellation (Standard Refund Slabs)

Refund is calculated on the Total Amount paid (unless otherwise stated at checkout), and may exclude non-refundable components disclosed during booking (e.g., permits already paid, third-party charges, special positioning already performed).

3.1 Refund slabs (by time before scheduled departure)

• 10% mandatory Cancellation Fees Applicable: after confirmed booking on total Booking Amount.
• 48 to 72 hours before departure: Cancellation allowed; a cancellation fee 20% apply and the refundable amount may reduce based on costs already committed.
• 24 to 48 hours before departure: Cancellation allowed; a cancellation fee 30% apply and the refundable amount may reduce based on costs already committed.
• 12 to 24 hours before departure: Cancellation allowed; a cancellation fee 50% apply and the refundable amount may reduce based on costs already committed.
• Less than 12 hours before departure: No changes or refunds (except as covered under Section 6 Force Majeure / exceptional cases).

3.2 No-show

If you do not cancel in time and do not report for the flight, payments already made are not reimbursed, except in limited force majeure situations that are contemplated under this Policy and reliably documented.

4) Booking Modifications / Rescheduling (Customer Request)

• Free modifications (date/time/route change requests) are generally possible only if requested at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure, subject to Operator availability and regulatory feasibility.
• Requests made inside 24 hours may be declined and treated as a late cancellation (see Section 3).

Fare difference: If the new schedule costs more, you must pay the difference. If it costs less, the refund (if any) will follow the same rules and may be reduced by committed costs.

5) Operator Cancellation, Significant Schedule Change, or Significant Delay

If the Operator cancels the flight and you choose not to travel (and you do not accept reschedule/credit), you are entitled to a refund of the ticket price/amount paid for the affected flight.

If there is a significant schedule change or significant delay and you choose not to travel (and you do not accept the alternate option), you are entitled to a refund.

If you accept an alternate flight/reschedule offered, a refund is generally not due for the same disruption.

6) Force Majeure / Exceptional Circumstances

Examples: extreme weather, natural disasters, regulatory restrictions, ATC/airport closure, curfew, strikes, civil unrest, or similar events beyond reasonable control.

• Where force majeure is established with reliable documentation, AirYatra may offer rescheduling or a refund even where the booking/rate would otherwise be non-refundable, depending on feasibility and committed costs.
• AirYatra may request supporting documents (official notifications, ATC/regulatory orders, etc.) to process force majeure exceptions.

7) Refund Method & Timeline

• Refund method: Refunds are processed back to the original payment method where possible.
• Timeline: Approved refunds are typically processed within 7–10 business days, depending on bank/payment gateway timelines.
• Deductions: Payment gateway/bank charges (if any) and non-refundable third‑party costs (if disclosed at booking) may be deducted.

8) Ancillary Fees (if any) & Baggage-Related Fees

• If a separately-charged ancillary service was unavailable through no fault of the Customer (e.g., service not provided due to cancellation), the related fee may be refundable.
• For baggage-related fees, refund eligibility depends on the nature of the fee and outcome.
• AirYatra itself does not provide insurance for baggage loss/damage; operational/baggage handling is governed by the Operator and applicable law/contract.

9) Fraud, Abuse, and Chargebacks

AirYatra may withhold or reverse refunds and/or suspend accounts in cases of suspected fraud, misuse, repeated chargebacks, or violation of Platform Terms.

10) Contact & Escalation

For cancellations/refunds:
• Support Email: care@airyatra.co.in
• Target response time: within 48 business hours.

11) Policy Updates

AirYatra may update this Policy from time to time. The version effective on the date of your booking/cancellation request will generally apply unless a change is legally required or improves your rights.
